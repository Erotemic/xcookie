The xcookie module is a CLI tool for initializing and maintaining standardized
repo infastructure. In other words it is a Python project cookie cutter that
attempts to help keep existing modules up to date with latest infastructure
developments.

Currently this module is specialized towards Erotemic / PyUtils / Kitware
projects but the goal is to eventually generalize everything.
